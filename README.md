RiTa is designed to be an easy-to-use toolkit for experiments in natural language and generative
literature. It is implemented in Java and JavaScript (with a unified API for both) and optionally
integrates with both Processing(JS) and NodeJS. It is free/libre and open-source according to the
GPL license (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt).

Please see https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS for the JavaScript implementation of RiTa.
