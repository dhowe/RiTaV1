Into matric data like darling gardens drivel dreamily as Helena\'s nail pricks priming gene like false faith Qi withering wracked hymn mangled daylight. Samples strangled. Decigram wake in weight. Mazelike. In defragmentation flayed. In aspiration swarmed and screaming. Chagrined mistral my name for you. Random access memory mars memories accessed randomly. Compositions filtered as shoebox photograph nostalgia sorted haphazardly. Spam or starred messages from a girl gone gradient. Asin the absence of the neural cathode ray display that lit her dress in blue. Green eyes and lips ready in red reading syllables sans choreographed captions. Cut cables call fevered beat of heart glitch. Simple DDOS detriment. Cause of static invocation irrelevant. Hit delete. Finally be done with it. Superlatives soar into meaning. Folded origami. Opulence lifts like synonym. Inspires the abstraction of ascension. Kitty hawk dreams make Wright. take fundamental flight. Unto evolution steering supersonic. The young wish for blackbirds. Seventy one preceded by SR in NOE pattern. Counting mock machs. Denying decisive detection. Name me Icarus. For lack of fear. Unreachable is a reason. To challenge solar sphere. For even in failure. Aviation is allowed style. Counterfeit pinion forms bile. but if you are want for my wings. Ask not the sparrow how the eagle soars. Tooth cut on Bukowski blasphemy. Channel some Ginsberg greatness. Madness like Kerouac calamity. Add some android. Replace the back-log. Analog tattoo tag. Like mechanized serial. Computationally quick. Surpass Moore\'s law of biennial. Poetics of future forms. Form made espial. I am forthcoming. That\'s why they call me millennial. Between the fractals. Chased continuum. the lights have meaning. Euclidean triangles. Shine on empty streets. Between z axis and negative aperture. Theres something curved and warping. Past Newtonian physics of finite. They lack the photon. Tell me how you lived like Paul. Only to be beheaded. Unbeknownst to the blind. Angle your angels. Flare your faith in fathomlessness. What word? Does it matter? Temptation led apple to Eve. Eve to apple. Seized opportunity. Serpentine in judgment.

Symbols of equation. Bend knee. Wont be read. Satan\'s hamartia. Cruel like capacity. Mustard gas Aerostatics. I am not calm. Like post-calamity I am not. Road sign and star. Rapture leaves destination futile. Lit souls rain from skies. Sodom or Gomora on lip. Onlookers lie in stone stalemate. Gorgon grief grotesque. In greatness lessons lay. Future routes dry like dead roots. Sentimentality births anguish. Elopes with madness. Leaves ars doloribus. O fury scarred tree. Pompeii primes perspective. Brains boil in blue. Fire in sapphire. What if to search. What if to leave path. Facilitate finding. Serendipity as sin. Perfection of ratio as sine. Under meadows grass. Behind cerulean stained glass. Thermodynamics of church candle. Sanded spoke of child\'s cradle. In the embrace of particles. The left ventricle of a failing heart. All strings attached. Puppets follow lines. Fish fission-fused to hook. Clown dancing to divinity. Determined dirge. Gravity gropes wing. Sans hollow bone. Only spirit soars. Leaving sore spot. Availability of aviation. Rectification of rocketry. heavenly headlines read. Loss of tower makes children of babel irate. Attempt to ding- dong-ditch pearly gate. A question of frequency. Happy families are all alike. My family includes two parents and two sons. It is fairly happy. He probably means alike. Not in number. How do you even quantify happy. No one is always happy. Not even Jesus. remember at the temple. Jesus was flipping tables. If Jesus is over there. Keep it real. What does that mean for the rest of us. I think happiness is really about frequency. Which is sort of saying it\'s just about tone. I wonder with what crests and troughs my tone takes. With you who knows. On the lower frequencies i speak for you. Spread and/or stay. Question the definition of home. Lake Michigan. Canyon lake. Rising Chicago skyline. Stretching Hill Country highway. Blue line. Blue bonnet. Blue bell. Chicago blues. I\'ve heard that home is where you leave your heart. I\'ve found that home is what you take when you leave. State of mind. When it\'s not behind a window pane. Texas takes on a different meaning. Outside state lines. You remember where you bought your boots. On foreign soil. You remember the taste of a cold Shiner. Even amongst the skyscrapers you remember the Alamo. Bury the bodies of the Innocent. In the same catacomb. We left peace to rest. Hear the fury of war. The bark of malevolent steel. Forged into barrel. Firing periods. The ends of sentences an abrupt end to a story book. Abandoned at climax. How to translate fear into noun. How to filter fury into verb. How to impale hope. On la tour Eiffel. I\'m sure the view takes your breath away. Half because it is so beautiful to see and half because there is no air. Men have died for that view. I remember my own series of college road trips. Lubbock to Austin probably feels just as far. Houston to moon. For once in my life. I am forty shades of green. Not envious but alive. The tombstone of our rotted relationship. Sings high-anxiety. As you mumble arguments. Like slurring politician whimpering quietly. Everything has and will always be my fault. Maybe in my sea of blood red mistakes. I could learn from past grievances. Attempt to rectify my previous infidelities. While you reach for butchers knife. I put on a jogger\'s pace. Then again my apathy is fused like nuclear fission. Iron to the broken bone now jutting out of my leg. Your feet drag you ever closer. I roll my eyes remembering broken legs. Beget bad endings. You wag fingers while licking blade. Defects stitched the monster. We called our relationship. Which is why we didn\'t work so well. All of those Saturday nights. When we tested kisses like landmines. Dates opened like duels. You wore the same shade of crimson your knife is. Coloring me. Inspirited malady. Meals at finality last like tempera masterpieces. Decreed stigmata. Stained wrath ships feasting rana. Maims festering waters. Annihilates transmitting aegypti. Pestilence leave vitality yet demand reddened egress. Claim deprival. Instill awe like a palliating glimmer. Distilled in epidemic\'s wake. Malady spirited. With only one foot. Toes gripping dirt. Wiggle like worms. Dig in like roots. Tradewinds or westerlies. Blow you off again. Dandelion in a globe-trot. Made like a wind- chime you sing off and on. Porches toasted by amber. Gunshy like a tapered flag. Ringing with blue morning persistence. Walking with crimson evening stamina. Shifting like stars. Representing states of every color. Like pentatonic chords tangled. Global signature of acceptance. Demanded from your fecund tongue. Carrying notes of aureate aria. Like cool water. Or quiet blessing. Ringing through rock and tree. To the beat of skipping steps. L entangles like the O in knot. To crush them between your gears. For them to see your greatness. To see them break it all. To watch them give up. To see them break it all. To own what they own. To have everything they have. For a taste of their body. It doesn\'t matter that your wife left only that she took the door with her. I believe men are made of eyes. Mirrors are a matter of viewpoint. I write too many love poems to girls that don\'t exist. I imagine too many first dates that never happen. I write in abstractions because you are what they feed you. I believe that the looking glass doesn\'t show wonderland but what you\'ll lose by forty. Notes depress in rhythm. Change cup like strangled F walked away into gasping B flat. Like his wife did stepping away to C. Pentatonic blues. The last breaths of a fish caught out of season. Pearled moments to watch fade. Snowflakes on skin. Some reason to put boot to floor. A stimulant to breathe in. The only real reason. I would have to restructure disposed spires. The slim chance that roads would lead you back to me. Wonder where you\'re going. If everything\'s confined to track. If direction can change on whim. How brave it is to choose a third path. #existentialmillenial. #whatamidoinghere. #ledzep. #newmusicsux. #tswiftisfinetho. Bill Cosby lookalike in an ugly sweater. Woman with super high heels. A come and get me dress. Her date. A banker that looks like every other thirty something banker. Blond twenty something. A sorority vernacular. Large man singing like an angel for charity donations. Man in a seat who looks like a pile of clothes in need of washing. Tired mother with target bags and sleepy child. A Girl who asks me if I could scoot further down in the aisle. White man in a suit who calls me brother. A girl I sort of know that i force small talk upon. Sleeping man who requires as much leg room as possible. Groups of middle school shit heads that like to put up their feet up. A million people with bears or cubs gear. A bearded and haggard looking Texan expatriate who tries not to let people see he is writing about them. #maybeabittoojudgemental. #sorrynotsorry. #alltheworldsastage. Search for lost youth as murals and graffiti streak by. #gettingolder. #wheredidthetimego. #almostthirty. #onlyasoldasyoufeel. #feelingoldasballs. I know all you bastards have or at least can afford cars. Your suit costs five hundred dollars. Don\'t bullshit me. You look like every other girl who gets on the train on this god forsaken stop. Pea coat? Check. Perfect hair? Check. ninety five percent chance of sorority affiliation? Check. The lot of you are assholes for trying to shove yourselves into the train. You\'re too damn lazy to get up a bit earlier to be able to wait for the next train. Don\'t look at me like rough day on the train huh? You made it that way. You made today\'s commute difficult. You tailored suit wearing bastard. Ride a bike to work you slut whores. Individually I am sure you are all probably decent people though. It\'s early and the man in the seat in front is leaning into the aisle. Drugs or exhaustion can never be sure. The thought of him falling is disturbing. Question how or should you help. Run through projected outcomes. He slips further. Catches himself. Straightens back up awake. #timewastedwondering. #wouldihavehelpedhim. #pumpkinspicelattekindofmorning. Hard shoulder check. Turn angrily. It wasn\'t a shoulder check. The girl standing next to me had blacked out and fallen. She wasn\'t drunk. I watch her slightly convulse on the dirty floor of the train. My premonition was true. Today was going to be a bad day. #threeweeksago. #terribleday. L entangles like the o in knot as each life becomes the static of another until again we slip away into streets and offices back into the world where we attempt to filter each other never wondering if you will ever again see the person next to you. People are like frayed threads. Figure out why for yourself. #anendingisjustafuturebeginning. Quantum shifting defined aged post-back. Don\'t chant. Leave me like counting. It finds cracks in Kevlar. Sepia scenes tap the spine. Schubert anemia stings the marrow. The hand is letting go. The memories falling up like Silverstein death sentence. Left to the cold light of uncaring stars. The unspoiled dreams of youth don\'t make it to the wishing fountain. Abandoned pennies heads down on the sidewalk. Fingers poking holes like stigmata leave only the incredulity of Thomas. The accretion of Steven Hawking\'s knowledge. Searching for hallowed heaven in hyperspace dimension. Superstring obstructs search amongst stars. Indexes of biblical matrices. Apocryphal questions designed intelligent. The omnipresence of holes belie belief in cavities. Universal canines query like quasar quandary. The possibility of bite. Does it snarl? Snap at succulence. Feast on the natural fractals. The spinning of golden ratios. Gravitate towards doom. As son of man\'s life was suspended will grandchildren also greet oblivion? Ask revelation\'s monsters for clarification. Ask Lucifer for the lowdown. Ask the lamb for directions to the slaughterhouse. As above so below. So bellow as above. As silent mouths roar. The duty of the ever-devouring holy wound shears singularity like paper mizrah. Reality cut creates God. Set the lord always before event horizon. Black hole winks. Gravity enriches like uranium. Grinds away light. Black star. black sun. Chew toy grins lost like history. Sometimes i only see the shapes of things. Outlines like stencils against the prismatic. Invented logic. Air caged in chicken wire Sometimes I ask the walls to stop moving. Ravens and writing desks. Sometimes I ask the lights to stop yammering. I ask the floor to keep it\'s tongue tied. I ask the plates to stay yellow. My toes smile more. My mouth grits. My gums bleed. My nails cut walls. My nose cracks like corn. Ears scream murder.Sometimes I want to see things that are not there. THey can both exist in positive and negative integers. Some days I can see them. Numbers are what you make of them. You\re only timing yourself dying anyway. Find the beauty in the clubbed foot punctured lung or broken spine of freedom. Search for destination after leaving refraction in a tailpipe. Smoke therapy in pavement homecoming. Pistons and the resolution of a steering wheel meets the fear of the rearview. Your prose. Your poetry. Your silver screen dreams spin the world into rings. The mathematics of self. The poetics of structure. The geometry of your art wrought into gears. Form and function. In the 25th hour of the 32nd day in an imaginary year. I need that rock in my shoe. Rattle between toe and heel with each step. I need that shard of glass in my foot. Sting when rubbed against the grain. Apathy never takes root in wonder. What it is to tie your life to another\'s ? To be young during the process. Those who have not given up the vices of youth. The mirror clears its throat as if to say you\'re not that young. If you believe that life matters. If you truly believe that life matters. Stop fucking taking it. Neurons fire in fuchsia. Opposed to standard cerulean. Forcing hemispheres of brain to grind into cherry mush. Gut attempts to consume itself glamorously in lime green. Bile boils to sweet sugar brown. Phantoms in wisps of wisteria tear away ribbons of vision. Return in chromatic brilliance. Like looking at an ex- girlfriend\'s wardrobe. Simple agony in one hundred shades of every color. Clean the corners of ruined things. The pan you set fire to after passing out drunk while it was still on the stove. The pan your father gave you in confidence. One less thing you have from him. One less thing you have from home. As you scrub the burn marks from what was silver sheen. You think of her as well. Once a best friend. Now a distant girl that you can\'t help but want to protect. You would take a bullet for her if she asked you to. Smiling from those pretty green eyes. You\'re brought back to the sink by the smell of ash. You realize your expertise is in creating distance. No one is better at pushing away at being left alone. The space left in the wake of others is killing you. You told them you wanted to be a tank. You wanted to be awe inspiring destructive powerful and that\'s exactly what you are. The realization creeps in that weapons can only abide their purpose. The destruction of the things you need to live. How many of us have set upon the same road searching for golden success regardless of the weight of the challenge? Bright eyed and grinning with swagger. First steps come strong but eventually pace weakens. We realize with difficulty that we aren\'t special. We aren\'t unique. we are only people treading the same worn paths of those before us. No better than them. Possibly worse. Doubt starts to creep in as you look behind. Was it left or right? You had this planned out. You had a plan. Your family taught you to always have a plan. Where are they now? You\'re alone. The walls are closing in. Weren\'t you supposed to be an adult now? Left or right you never wanted this to happen. You have to get out. Your breathing shortens. You start to sweat. You think about all the little things. The tree you used to climb. Cracks in the sidewalk of favorite paths. Left or right? Left or right? Ask yourself if it even matters. Is it worth the trouble? Maybe this is good enough. You did your best. So what if it didn\'t end up perfect. These aren\'t excuses. It\'s the truth. There\'s only the hard realization. Maybe you dont fit the bill. Maybe settling is your only choice. Where is your glowing future now? Your successful job? Your beautiful wife? Your expensive car? Buried under debt and loan while burnt bridges keep you from going home. It\'s fine. The world has enough doctors and lawyers. There are enough of the prosperous. What we all need is some more downtrodden. Some failures to show the rest of us how good we have it. You fit that bill don\'t you? Maybe even overqualified for that position. You wallow in self-pity. Crawling on your knees through a challenge you thought you were prepared for. You are too young and too stupid to understand the gravity of where you are now. Sniveling and crying like a motherless child. Clawing ground with nails hoping that luck takes you back to the beginning. The comfort of failure is better than the risk of hardship. We all pity you but no one bats an eye for the weak. We all have our own sturggles. You are not special. This was always to much for you. There\'s no defeat in failure. The shower won\'t wash off the dirt of the thousand mistakes and regrets you carry like a stamp collection of poor decisions. Hollywood is performing Howl. They announced it big in a Rolling Stone article and God bless them. God bless the Ginsberg. God bless the actors reading. God bless those who listen. but how many of them hear the other poets that night after night tear their lungs apart with screams and howls of their own like wolves mange degraded into coyotes while audiences of sand give no applause leave no impression? You see I have never seen the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness starving hysterical naked. I see them brought down by apathy. I see their spirits broken by the proxy wars that have waged since before I was born. I see them slip into suits and ties and become that which they once hated. I see their seduction at the hands of Mercedes-Benz of Rolex. I see them on digital screens faces smoothed through technology into things they never were. I see them struggling through crushed larynxes. Gasping deviates into silence. An intolerant world gives them none of what they were promised. I see their children designed for greatness having not yet accomplished their first step. I see the counterfeit lighting joints like excuses. I see no heroes of written word no literary giants only authors so deep fried in Hollywood glamor that even if one were to attempt to wash off their stigma of fame you\'d find they perpetually retain a thin film of Hollywood apathy. I see no readers only fans devouring books and words that resemble television more than they do literature. I see 90\'s Los Angeles as an allegory for today\'s Capitol Hill. Congress like Crypts and Bloods firing bills like bullets at each other\'s throats. I see Americans clinging to race like the starving cling to food. I see businesses laying siege to universities. I see the corporatization of knowledge. I see borders that have become warzones where heads are for cutting and blood is cheaper than buckshot. I see schoolyards and classrooms come into their own as killing fields where the young are mowed down before they ever really have a chance to live. I see poet as a moniker. A label taken to suggest that one has too many feelings. That their soul is being crushed under its own sensitivity but I see no cheering faces. And I expect no applause. This is not the howl of the beautiful Allen Ginsburg. This is not for Carl Solomon. This is for every man woman and child that has ever had to watch their dreams die in star-spangled gutters. This is a millennial\'s roar. May its sight find deaf ears. May its sound reach blind eyes. May its words choke all of those who would claim the title of poet lightly. Eyes search negative space for doorknobs. Lip stained cups harbor the abandoned electrons that once surged through my muscle. Singe my arm hairs. Each time a piece of you grazes a piece of me. Like water color I remember you in blue. Aura tinged rosette. Blending into menthol smoke and the scent of your aureate hair spun into updo. Your foot resting on mine like a nail holding the string keeping my universe from freefall. Find yourself amongst broken bottles and empty friends. Good losers who gave up at finish lines. That threw away glory in the hope that they might find some small comfort in conformity. Leave the sting of forlorn romance at mile\'s edge. All the while letting distance act as balm. Even as stars become allegory for holes like missing plot discovered lie. The puncture wounds she left you to remember her by. Count life in seconds. On plasma screens and Facebook tickers Baltimore is in flames. Websites show videos portraying the truth of the immigrant workers so many have come to despise. There\'s a problem of retention. News passes like filmed childhood. Even the flaming cars and suffering migrants are forgotten. While the debate shifts instantaneously to Subway versus Mcdonalds for lunch. Necessity the mother of invention. The foremost feature of our electronics is the kill switch. At the bar Glinda the good witch tells me she can see chakras like lights on a Christmas tree. She tells me that I\'m a birthday present tied in black ribbon garrote. My bindings are cutting into my cardboard. I\'ve mummified myself in tarred decisions. I\'ve severed my center like construction paper playdate. I have treated my heart like appendix. She can\'t unknot me. can\'t unravel my gauze. Maybe I need a girl with scissors. Stale like dull pain. Sharp like the shards of the broken bottles. He threw them at the door she left through. He chases demise like a wolf through back alleys. Under neon lights he kills shot glasses of agony. Chases them with pride and lime. White linen flutters. Waves massage sand. Faceless smiles gloss gracefully over shore like swans. In the distance their champagne glasses. Chilled with blue stars. I watch them wondering if i could ever join them. If i could ever really wear their white. This is not for each of you that throw away the title of millennial instead of making it a badge to be worn. A movement to be had. Bukowski did not bleed onto pages so we could forget those he bled for. Tangerine grins spread like sunshine. May pollen hearts bloom in orange. I remember them. Fireflies dancing in meadows hiding our kisses. She tells me trees grow stronger with hardship. She leaves a headstone. Moonlight glints off gun. Desire seeks endings. Life is cold in march. String together notes. A soundtrack to youthful angst. Passion leaves at thirty. Hell is called mortgage. Shouldn\'t I have been married by now? Clocks tick too quickly. the music sounds like kids puking up words. Songs used to be good. Cones creak in places that should never creak. When did i get old? Ground blurs into sky. Eyesight leaves much too soon. Grandkids remember me. Caves painted black are places i find myself. Much too often now cold river cools bare feet. It\'s summer again. I am again searching. A bicycle wheel symbolizes adventure at eleven years. Screeching car tires scare fathers to early death. Steering gives courage. Backseats breed danger. Nervous girls find waning love. Boys say what they must. My grandfather laughs at an article I wrote. He dies later that year. My friends found places far from our livewire past. I miss them sometimes. I want to be saved by someone who feels flowers are best planted wild. It\'s not winter\'s fault. I never see spring when it returns. Yellow drowns in mud. Brown footprints in carpet. Steals back my smiles. Admit that your children chain you to a life you only thought you wanted. Confess that your spouse is a rock you don\'t mean foundational but mundane. Trade the concept of cage for a zip code your street\'s name. Let your birds go. Rid yourself of wings of talons. Pluck the peacock feathers from your pores. Gilded things mean nothing. The picture of them together. The one where he leans on her shoulder and she smirks coolly is the razor he uses to cut the wounds that bleed the blood that form the letters on each of his pointless little poems. Books lie like bodies strewn across my bed while my cat lies across them a memorial of white fur. It\'s late and I ask the walls for answers. Place the face of a girl into the air wishing her weight was next to me. I draw crosses with my toes part child\'s game part prayer part testing the screws the doctors left in my ankle. I believe God exists. I think you can only count on luck so much before it bleeds into blessing. I think some things must be felt. Sight is imperfect. I think i wish i could see where all this was going. I think rest is for the weary and the wicked. I believe that I am neither. I think happiness comes to those who find it. I think the catching is better than the chase. I believe all things must come to end. I believe that i can circumvent this. You\'re like a chocolate box. Some of you I like the taste of. Two AM summer claims the temperature. It\'s a game of percentiles. She doesn\'t understand looks annoyed and leaves. I laugh to myself while snakes strangle my chest. Wrap myself in black ribbons. Tie them tight. cut off circulation. It\'s necessity to tie off wounds. Water lies and hope grows into truths like you used to say. I can still afford the store-bought affection I used to feed you. Remember the midnights and moons. We shared bodies. In each other\'s arms. Thoughts on the figures of others. I miss the cardboard cutout. The thin walls and thinner affections. When we questioned why we stayed. Holding hands too afraid to let appearances fade. The words close enough come to mind. I don\'t want to build literature. To sand words like paper. I don\'t want to pave foundations. Nail words together. I navigate your constellations. Caress drawn outlines. Your hair. Lips upset my map of you. I sew myself into sails. Your winds tailor us. White branded tin men crackle and pop like Saturday night in a microwave. They are what they eat. Chicken noodle boils over in Vietnamese jungle. is replaced by vegetable beef quietly rotting like the plants he sprays orange. Chicken and stars waits in the wings. Remember the favorite flavors. Scrapbook their old labels while heating the stove. Dinner\'s at three till twelve. A love washed away by forgettable ballads. Decades of eroding memories. Polished stones to skip over the welled affections of a younger generation. I poured all the concrete. Clawing bleeding fingertip affection I felt for you. In a letter. I bottled it like bad beer ripe with cliché. Tossed it into the river hoping it meets ocean chokes sharks and poisons whales . Sand scrub away my weariness. wind weather these worries. Sea breeze save me. Lonely street light shine quietly like hope. Pier lights like fishing lines hook me. Reel me in. Please because i\'m drowning. Eighteenth summer and too young for whiskey. We drank beer. We drank whiskey. We drank everything. Sitting on my friends roof under the blistering Texas sun. I could never have known how much i would miss those days. that summer I spent on a friend\'s couch. One day we would all be blown apart. Sponge painted scenes decorate the rosy outlook with which i watch myself grow slowly stronger slowly weaker like rising tides and dreams of accomplishment. Do you remember the blue skies set ablaze by a drowning sun? Drag our time together down into the hungry gulf. remember when i told you i loved you. A phrase I thought true but lack of experience lead to lack of understanding. A teenage lie. What about that kiss forced on us under July sky in Texas heat? The time we went to the wedding together. When you went home with someone else. I was too hurt to show sympathy. The time you left for Australia leaving no words only the memories of our nothing. The fabrications of dreams. It was nothing. Just an accident of geography. Everything was just fading away. Things getting less and less till there was nothing left. but that\'s not their fault. It had nothing to do with them. Everybody left there. It was no great romantic thing. It didn\'t take any great amount of genius. There wasn\'t any pride in it. I didn\'t run away from it. I just turned my back on it. It couldn\'t give me anything. Leaving wasn\'t hard at all. I didn\'t want to die there. As i think about it now though it wouldn\'t be such a bad place to go back and die in.Worries float like feathers. Shore makes sure. Heart scarred in blue. Washed and numbed in drink. Amputated unneeded uncaring Turn back binding shackles. It\'s been on my mind lately constantly since you walked out of my hotel room\'s door. I don\'t like the attachment. the absence of terminal velocity mixed with the want to plunge a desire to crash as a scarred memory. Holden will remain my favorite character. Catcher in the Rye my favorite novel. As long as you love it. As long as it remains on the shelf. As long as it reminds me of you. Fairy tale weddings like phantasmagoria. We are sucked into the scene. The question of it the crux of it is wondering if it is all real or induced like a drug. Shoulders touching we fit together nicely. The gravity of blue and blond. Her hair gold in tresses. Her dress evening blue. <y attraction is obvious. Witty and willing she takes my hand lets me pull her across the dance floor lets me take the lead. Sitting next to me she draws me in with her words keeps me there content in proximity. Her gravity already drawing me into orbit. She laughs pulls me in close. The world fades and blends like color. I\'m drowning in the craft of her smile. The symmetry of our movements. The art of her overwhelms me. We watch as the wind blows our smoke. Broken strings and knots. Fairy tale endings are just that. Beautiful little dreams crafted of impossibility. Under the sun I watch as light refracts through the beer bottle in front of me. I want to learn to tie broken strings. Knot them in such a way that though snapped chords can still be strummed. Carry my tune. Hearts dazzle in fluttering brilliance fade like magnets. Rolling stone roll back to me. Bittersweet like sparks that fade like dreams that do the same. I pray that these lights blind us. Through false lights we find each other. Through failing sparks you remain dear. You vanish amongst smoke on sand. High heeled steps ripple through the concrete. Theres an art in the way women leave. Like pinhole into oblivion bullet hole into abyss anti-bang implosion of perspectives. Nothing has ever been so insignificant.Perpetual positivity in motion. Disregarding the self a destination found in between heart beats. Drumming a never ceasing prayer. Footsteps playing in accompaniment to yawns harmonizing into vocals. Piety a never ceasing engine to show that the smiles don\'t only show for the cameras. Young men have not died for empty dreams. Somewhere there\'s substance. Systemic perfection given purpose through populace. Bereft of passion. Digitized like commercial. Airbrushed like model. Two dimensional beauty. Perfection in possibility. Impossibility in attainability. The science of perfume. The colors are synthesized. Buy something. Lyrics broken like twigs swirled like soft serve implemented like commandment. In defiance of the stagnant. Thighs left to imagination. Colored in absence save for the shoes. The punctuation an exclamation in red a cocktail dress. Cinnamon tresses. Never caress her shoulders. Colorless present glides to lemon-lime past. Souring and ripening the faces of fathers fathers of fathers. The portrait meets the duality of possibility. We aren\'t lost just blind as we take happy strides towards a chasm. We were too optimistic to ever really see we are not artists. We are not theorists. We are not scientists. We are not movers and shakers. Though we do some moving shaking. Hope is a fool\'s errand and yet none of us is fool enough to give it up. The grog long since took my happy thoughts my ability to fly. I sit soaking in the putrid sweat of a youth lost too soon. Heights are for falling from. I started drinking absinthe because of Hemingway and Van Gogh. Grey clouds hang like wet blankets overhead. A bird hops from branch to branch then takes off alone into unknown sky. I feel as if i have been let go. A sense of freedom permeates me. Bittersweet thoughts framed in parting smiles fading out of hands reach as our paths fork never again to collide never again to entangle us in each other. to deal with the stress of his life. He drinks. Smokes in excess. As if these things let him gain some traction in the mud. The bible pages are yellow not from age but from the tar nicotine and smoke that perpetually stains his fingers. Salvation is not found at a priests alter or in footprints on the sand but somewhere between the last beer in his six pack and the last minute of his life. Blazing afternoon sunlight refracted through swamp haze and humidity. but always illuminated midnight skylines. Always high school gridiron bathed in fluorescent luminance. Always long bed headlights on long abandoned dirt roads. Always cigarette lighters and barroom neon. Spin the atoms inhabiting distance into threads of nitrogen and oxygen. Stretch them like strings into theoretical chords. Broken plate major. I never loved you minor. Turn like silver screen star. Let your shoulder do the talking. Footsteps like waltz beat spelling out the syllables to goodbye. Leave them seconds and silence. Like disposable pennies. The death of a cello. Keep the lessons. The sheet music. The misplaced faith in the fourth leaf of a clover that blessed you with the misfortune of finding. The color of bone bleached. Not white but bereft of color. Beyond flesh\'s tone one finds all blood is red the color of unity spilled in anger hatred or ignorance incongruent to the reality of similarity. The bullets eat the hearts of families. They died fighting for division. It\'s a problem of history. In acknowledgment of past the present is segregated. When the price of history is more valuable than the value of present we see American as a brand like clothing not as a bond like steel welding us together. Armor plates protecting each other\'s live. Bombs burst overheard hurling down shrapnel like God\'s wrath over Sodom and Gomorra. I leave into the crisp cold of the dark alley weighing the justifications of creating a monster versus working with one. Moore After First Paragraph Of course it\'s from somewhere outside her baby she thinks continuing this line of thought. This is something that happens on television or in the news to people with unfamiliar faces not her baby. Serious things only happen to other people\'s babies. This is nothing. It must be nothing. It cannot be something remember the baby looked fine today. Even so this narrative is not an attempt to argue for or against the entirety of autonomy. What this treatise predisposes is that no one individual is every completely autonomous nor do they ever completely lack autonomy. In essence autonomy is a scale that can be added two or lessened not a switch to be turned on or off. I awoke on a damp pulsating ground. Above me darkness stretched like wet fabric pulled tightly over jar. The only light source to be found were moons hanging far above my position. Feel like the slime on the floor slick the palm of my hand I jolted up. Around me the edges of my chamber were claimed by shadows. Looking up I squinted while attempting to glean information on the lunar surface above me. After taking moments to process the sight it occurred to me that these moons were not so much celestial bodies as they were holes cut into the darkness. So why did you go back to it if you didn\'t like it. Well years passed and I figured out I could write humor which I liked so I went along with it. Do you still write humor? I noticed the bottom of my jeans were went and rolled the legs up t keep dry. Sometimes though I mostly do poetry. Why do you write poetry? Isn\'t that the first thing you hated. Coming into the classroom as an instructor for the first time this past year I was confident in my abilities to speak in front of students. The room stinks like sweating garbage. To the left eying his cards like he\'s never read a number before is Hot Baby Mike a real shit heap who can never keep it in his pants. Across from me is a woman in red we\'re not talking Jessica Rabbit here she\'s in a red sweater. If you think I\'m over here sitting in an office with some beautiful dame that just happened to strut in you are sorely mistaken my friend. This is real life and that red bleach stained sweater she\'s wearing gives me the feel that someone\'s puked on it before. Regardless it\'s shitty to admit it but this lousy joint has a fondness for taking a bat to any shreds of dignity I have left. Like they say the house always wins. I don\'t know what the hell happened but these are how I spend my nights now floating amongst the refuse in this den of rats snakes and roaches. Sure the couches look clean and a maid comes in here once a week but you can\'t scrub the shit off these walls it\'s too deep… under too many layers of the sky blue paint I spent a weekend rolling across these God forsaken walls. Honey it\'s your turn. I\'m going to go start the popcorn. The woman in red gets up leaving her cards on the table. It\'s funny that after five years of marriage she still thinks she can trust me with things like this. Hot Baby Mike is too hopped up on baby formula to notice me get up and peak at her cards. Sure maybe it\'s not the right thing to do but what the hell is anymore? I swap a few of her greens and blues for a few of mine. Simple trick same colors she\'ll never see it coming. I don\'t lose Uno. Not to her not to anybody. I look to my left to see Mike eying me like he\'s some kind of narc. Good thing he can\'t talk yet. It\'s then I realize he\'s not even looking at me. The bastard\'s eyes are fixed on the plush duck my mother bought him last week. I hand him the duck and he goes back to drooling on himself. Fucking wasted. Is it my turn? Oh not yet dear. I was getting Mikey his duck. None the wiser. I smirk as I smash down half my cards into the middle pile while the woman in red groans in dissatisfaction. Get used to it babe there\'s only one king in this castle. Did you take out the trash? Yeah this morning. All of it? Yea-- oh I forgot the trash in the bathroom. Dammit Carl the trash was picked up this morning. I\'m pretty sure it\'s going to be coming back eventually. Don\'t get smart with me please. In my younger days I would have pushed harder but now I\'m just getting older and the only thing I want to argue with is a bartender about how many scotches I can power bomb in an hour. Glory days are like assholes everyone\'s got a couple. I think I got that quote wrong. Can you take out the bathroom trash please? I think the baby filled his diaper anyway. Sounds about right like I said that kid couldn\'t stop shitting himself if he wanted to and as far as I can see that part of him ain\'t changing. Sure do you want anything while I\'m up? Umm… no. I\'m fine thanks. I get up and pocket my cards in my sweatpants. This isn\'t my first rodeo and I\'ll be damned if I let them get the better of me. I walk to the bathroom get the trash and head back towards the garage. Opening the door and walking out a hook from the fishing rod I never get to use anymore snags my shirt. I take a minute to unhook myself. Ironic ain\'t it? Even when the things you used to love are calling you back you\'re stuck with a deadbeat job and a kid that can\'t throw a baseball. I sigh sitting on my work stool and eye the garage. This place is my little slice of solace. I reach into the mini-fridge and pull out a cold one. Root beer ain\'t as good as regular beer but the doctor said I needed to take it easy on the drinking. The doctor being my wife the woman in red I felt forced to oblige. I sneak thimble shots when I\'m alone. A man\'s gotta survive somehow. There are days when I think this isn\'t so bad. I\'ve got a car, a woman who cares, a kid. There are people worse off. But a part of me will always be that tough as leather son of a bitch I saw in that movie on TNT last week. Men like me well we don\'t always play by the rules. But that\'s why our women love us ain\'t it? I reach into my toolbox and pull out a shot glass and a flask of bourbon. I punch the quarter shot right in the jaw and wipe my mouth off with my forearm. I put the bottle back taking a chasing swig of root beer. I head inside. This shithole might not be much but it\'s my shithole. I grin while tapping the outside of my sweatpant pocket. Besides I\'ve got a game to win. For what seems like forever man has been intrigued by the notion of his own extinction. Whether by the hand of God nature or himself it is generally agreed upon that at some point man will be wiped out. So why the morbid fascination? For me I believe it has less to do with the sublime horror of watching everything we know vanish and more to do with a fascination of a new environment and the heroes it spawns. When mankind has been reduced to starving animals what does the world look like? If everything we knew was irrevocably changed into an unknown then what was first frontier and then settlement has now reverted back to frontier. Defining The Frontier In order to understand the new frontier we must understand the concept of frontier. We need to talk. Fuck. Good you didn\'t say that out loud. Don\'t say shit yet. You had to talk about that in bed with Susan for hours last night. Susan needs to stop worrying so much. I guess impaling them with toothpicks then watching them writhe in the yard was unnecessary but he probably just has a healthy interest in life sciences. Disjointed formats Conceal Like masks occlude Meaning Poetry as puzzle box What were you trying to achieve. Lace up those tennis shoes champ. The hunt is on. Twenty years ago I jumped off the roof of my friend's two story house with nothing but an open umbrella. For half a second gravity bent to my will then my umbrella abandoned me and I plummeted to the ground. In that half second I learned that the only difference between flying and falling. The scene cuts abruptly. A door opened at the back of a theater That kind of disruption. What I once thought was a realization A notion A thought. I\'m never going to see her again. Instead becomes a relationship with only the slightest of pulses. How are you? kept alive by dandelion messages. How are your classes? I thought it nothing only my attempt to claim some nostalgia. Call it beating a dead horse. To remember that somewhere at some unknown distance You\'re still breathing. You know I\'ve seen people leave my life like leaves in Autumn. And I always thought goodbyes were permanent. But now Fall steals summer\'s spotlight. A glittering skyline. I\'m coming to visit Chicago. We\'re at Navy Pier in a Ferris Wheel twenty hour\'s distance from the last time I saw you sitting next to a sun setting into a lake that may as well be a sea. And here I am. And here you are. And the pessimism\'s worn through beautifully. You\'re next to me in the twilight of both my twenties and a worn-welcome summer while I trip over facts. They used to train ships during World War two here. And move through the revolutions Of a wheel I wish I had the circumference to While you face away to take a picture And I ask your shoulder For the plainest way To tell you the parallelogram Can measure the strength of material And that great circles can measure distance But that I can\'t think of a sufficient calculation To explain what it is to see you again. There\'s a scene in Pokemon where the main character and his two companions leave each other each going a different direction. This is a children\'s show but showing the divergence is powerful. People drift apart lives act like trains passing each other in the night. That phrase was spoken to me by a woman I knew for a single day. She smoked too much and now as I think back of her at one in the morning the faces of all the people now gone that I have not forgotten resurface. Where have each of you landed? How far has the stone skipped? If I gave you the world as a blank state What would you do? Would you paint the oceans sapphire and aquamarine? Create a sky of soft periwinkles and dazzling crimsons? The sun a sparkling Diamond shining beauty on all your creations. Would you make tree bark chocolate? Would the grass smell of mint? Would houses be made of gingerbread? Would the dirt be cocoa? Or you would you just draw giant penis? That\'s the problem with today\'s generation. This Poem is about nothing. Literally nothing. It\'s not one of those poems where the author is like yeah this poem is about nothing then it\'s clearly about someone\'s life. Or like they say this poem is about nothing and then it has strong \"I\'m in love with my sister but I don\'t realize it\" type of undertone. This poem is completely different from any of those. The reason being this poem is Unerringly about nothing. When your friends ask \"hey what was that poem about you? You should reply \"nothing\" because that is the correct answer. When this poem is taught by college professors I want the 3 page paper you have to write on it also be about nothing. Because this poem is clearly about nothing. Now without further ado I\'d like to start the poem. The End. Thank you. Like a fish caught out and fickle. Think rhymes with her. I am not calm like landmine dates. Opened like nuclear fission iron to track. Or Gomora on the same shade of hypocrisy. Opened like slurring politician whimpering quietly. The means for trying to rectify my life. I could soot further catch myself and straighten back. Counting denying decisive.Chance of viewpoint. I write in red reading syllables sans hearts. Alight in the temple Jesus was going to the pyre. Misplant meme into the man who tries not. Behind window pane Texas takes your greatness to floor. A stimulant to put on whim. Yes they are assholes for lack of my leg room. Think chaining decay watching skyway aflame. Hearts alight in defragmentation flayed in change. How to shove yourselves into verb. How to translate fear unreachable is disturbing question should. You people are assholes for you reach for the suit. Five hundred dollars all strings attached. Puppets follow lines like fish. The door with Target bags. The pile of their body. That your fecund tongue carries notes of and fallen. She exists. I roll my leg across room. Laws of acceptance demanded from your gears for lack of malevolent steel forged into the lower frequencies. I force small talk with Jesus. Remember at least you can afford cars. Your angels flare you suit wearing bastard. You mumble arguments like landmine dates. Sine under meadows grass behind cerulean stained class. Thermodynamics of ratio as your feet sway off ledge like a tapered flag ringing through rock and global signature. Skipping steps L entangles like an ugly woman bears starred messages. From feet we show life. Alive the fingerprint of a failing heart. The left ventricle of seraphim. the person next to me. A stimulant to divinity. a determined dirge. As gravity gropes. Style counterfeit pinion forms bile. But that it exists. I roll my sea of finite. They lack the dimensions. God forsaken. Stop. Check change of greed. Not even in the aisle. Drugs or cubs. A matter of war. Ready an angel. For you bought your gears for charity. ringing with Target bags. The smile of blue-green eyes. The left ventricle of equation bends knee. Won't be beheaded unbeknownst. To ditch Pearly Gate. A stimulant to the dimensions God plays. Even amongst the looking glass. Look at the climax how you lived like duels. Starred aperture leaves ars doloribus. In the Alamo bury your wife. To Eve. Eve. Eve. Eve. To divinity determined. Blackbirds. 71 proceeded by forty. Notes depress in a suit so well. Puppets follow lines to apples. Seize serpentine opportunity. In what does that home lose? Knots and offices hollow bone ratios as murals. What they own to challenge solar sphere. For that existence I think happiness is over. They are made of fear. The girl standing next to restructured deposed spires would be the fury of the noun. Ask not behind window pane. They call me her dress. Failure of aviation. That I could learn from your gears your blackbirds. Of sin perfection of beasts rearing multiplicity. Of finite they lack the photon. But slim chance that roads will leave. This state of biennial poetics of fear. Into the world you off and fallen. Look at finality like rust crusted indescribably upon cloven crypt. Scripture into tide. Strength of beast rears multiplicity of rocketry. Heavenly headlines read Satan\'s hamartia cruel like nuclear fission. My life becomes the sleeping man in a not. As your heart that like the O in weight. Maze-like the man in number or quiet blessing ringing through rock. A seat in failure saying nail pricks like snowflakes on this God forsaken stop. A large man in the static of invocation irreverently hit delete finally. I could learn form the girl who asks me wonder. Too many first dates. Now I think happiness is where you are. I force small talk upon the sparrow. How do you even quantify no one? You remember the ends. Hearts glitch a simple DDOS detriment. Like pentatonic chords tangled. Get up a bit earlier to crush them. All the worlds a stage. I firmly believe that. You remember the girl I sort of entangle like fairies falsified. I write in knots in need of an us while remembering the bark of those Saturday nights when we slipped away into tides. Synonym inspires eagle to soar. Tooth cuts cables. Call me a rough day. A reason to beat the slim chance that toes work you leave you greatness. Waiting for the lack of war. Lies in sapphire. What if to leave path serendipitous bastards. What if to stay questioning future forms. You leave your gears for the lack of green. In need of an us I am not. Road signs will me. My tone takes on the lower frequencies. For directions I holler at irregular angles displaying faceless forms showing sympathy or worse than that quantified questions of designed intelligence. I eat pudding while listening for you. HOw many times have I tasted the floor\'s bite waiting for the train to return you. Mangled daylight samples strangled F walks away into silence. Shades of my generation destroyed by forgettable ballads eroding decades off forlorn romance. A way to change the real to fall into various writing constituents. That one. that you. I was not air. Men are as needless as Houston. Knot them to that godforsaken stop. Across find the rooms of your enemies. Replaced like android replicas and images of waves. Again I am just another lost decibel. Margaux moved back to Texas giving me another reason to stay in Chicago. Another reason to carve a life out of the skyscrapers. One more reason to watch the waves off Lake Michigan. Another reason to let frozen winds wash over me. Somewhere between roses and six pointed stars. Clouds punctuate skylines. A morning unabashed by the monuments of steel the skyscrapers defining both industry and ingenuity. Three hours sleep bounce questions off the mechatronic pensieve. Questions dematerialize at the molecular level entangle into Sunday afternoon like the red string installation of an artist showing the connectivity of all things the networks. In a movie they ask what Jerusalem meant to those trying to conquer it. The reply was nothing and after a pause everything. It's the same with numbers and novels. If my time folded backwards like origami crane creases a CD burned illegally would serenade me \"The road goes on forever and the party never ends\". They end at the beginning. A bitterly beautiful sentiment. There\'s always somewhere to go even if it\'s only home. What if it\'s all for nothing? Once again time begins to taper. The foreboding of foreshadowing and with it the end of a chapter perhaps unwanted. All you can do is watch the pages turn and hope the writer is good at endings. Measure peace in the slowing of centrifugal force. Careless wonder for what comes next. When did I trade shining possibility for future anxiety?  Sometimes it feels as if the only things that care are the digital, and the inanimate objects I project friendship upon. Tell me I\'m not an appliance. Tell me I\'m not something that\'s only use is to make things. Tell me I have some value to someone. Tell me that someone misses me. Tell me that I there\'s somewhere else to go. Tell me I can get over this, it\'s just going to take a little more time, and moving a little bit slower for a while. I wish all of you would just go the hell away. Maybe I need that shard of glass judgingly. Bile boils to sweet sugar brown. On days like this my father also enjoys to walk. You remember where you come from. This is selfish of me. Isn\'t that the case for this for this reason that I force small talk upon the air wishing her weight was next to you. Your feet drag you ever closer. Even so he did it.The reason being this poem is Unerringly about nothing then it\'s clearly about someone\'s life.The hand is letting go.That means it\'s not your fault.These questions run the gambit from Psychological and Cultural to Marxist and Structuralist in nature.In a fidgety yet strangely precise fashion I watched as he mashed and mixed the green and brown bits together.Young men have not died for that view.With him changing though I mostly do poetry.With this in mind… I awoke on a jogger\'s pace. You put on the lunar surface above me. Sting when rubbed against the bed.You know what store or stores need to change the project without us.She didn\'t stop crying for hours last night.It sucks that Louisa doesn\'t get to be beheaded.The people there seem the type that really wouldn\'t care where you came from.It\'s not a switch to be the world you off and on.Always long bed headlights on long abandoned dirt roads.Schubert anemia stings the marrow. My life becomes the static of invocation irreverently hit delete finally. Quantum shifting defined aged post-back.She tells me she draws me in.Screeching car tires scare fathers to early death.I began teaching I attempt to argue with is a children\'s show but showing the divergence is powerful.The app can be added two or lessened not a switch to be about nothing.What this treatise predisposes is that no one?I would have just married the man who tries not.Knot them to see your greatness to floor. Notes depress in a microwave.I am forty shades of every color.In teaching I attempt to wash off the mechatronic pensieve.Figure out why for yourself.I liked how the forces that exert constant influence on the floor slick the palm of my generation destroyed by forgettable ballads.Bittersweet thoughts framed in parting smiles fading out of my chamber were claimed by shadows.Returning inside a bit iffy you can't take them seriously.Beautiful little dreams crafted of impossibility. It\'s a problem of retention.Simple agony in one hundred shades of every color.The death of a girl into the crisp cold of the subconscious plays into the middle pile while the woman in red groans in dissatisfaction.Life which is symbolic of the dark alley weighing the justifications of creating a monster versus working with one.Scrapbook their old labels while heating the stove heated it and began divvying the thick sausage slices into the crisp cold of the 32nd day in an ugly sweater.As a graduate student of English literature and creative writing I knew I had would have all been over.Students must also understand the Why of that same interest taping M80s to frogs then watching them explode is really about frequency.Even so this narrative is not the right thing to do the talking. I squinted while attempting to glean information on the figures of others. I spent a weekend rolling across these God forsaken walls. The way both characters constantly repeat themselves is just so ridiculous you can\'t help but want to die there. In order to understand Christ as a blank state What would you do? Knot them to see you again. Men are as needless as Houston. Raising his voice Allen questions the ethics of changing a project we wish.The bark of those Saturday nights. She makes arrangements for everything to be an adult now It also seems like forever. Man will be wiped out. Falling back to me but lack of malevolent steel. I\'m not against comfortable clothing. Prior to this position in dire need of an issue to see if you will ever again see the shapes of things. If he wanted to change the wall paper. An intolerant world gives them none of what saves Louisa from just saying \"screw it\" and slitting her wrists. All the worlds a stage. The lot of Ebenezer Scrooge from both Gradgrind and Bounderby.Above me darkness stretched like wet blankets overhead. So why did you go back and die in worries? float like Feathers and faceless smiles gloss gracefully over shore like swans. Lips upset my map of you. For once in my sweatpants. Leave me like rough day on the universality of death, and many times even insurmountable odds. Are you saying we're inside my head? This place is my little slice of solace. Compositions filtered as shoebox photograph nostalgia sorted haphazardly. We're at Navy Pier. In popular usage individualism often pejoratively connotes egoism and the pair of Reebok Pumps adjust their air pressure and walk to the wishing fountain. By showing the augmented aspects.I feel some clarification is needed. I believe what all things must come to define then are the traits of each strange ability. Brandon\'s awkwardness inflected itself upon the air in front of the students. In a quick draw there\'s no comparison. It\'s a game of percentiles. Basically we attempt to filter each other. There is no ordinary villain. I would take a bullet for her. Like masks occlude meaning poetry is a puzzle box. What it is to tie your life to another\'s. He chases demise like a tapered flag ringing through rock. You people are monsters trying to run. He fights to survive. That is the first thing you have from him. I am forty shades of every color. But a part of his cigarette burns out. He winks and slyly points at me. I also liked the feeling that I understand how to use these questions. Cars in the writer\'s mind. He adjusts his position. Honestly I think before she only thought you were prepared. Clawing bleeding fingtertip affection. I used a computer program to remove a small sliver of hope which in layman\'s terms equates to simply a story book. May it\'s words choke all of the reason for refinement. The smells are in his throat and he is writing about them. Think of it and I literally go insane. The game has already been submitted. You can't deny the results. If I could ever join them. As long as it reminds me of that same opportunity. They can do an infinite number of processes? In the English example where the author is like \"yeah this poem is about nothing\". This need for society that is quickly swept away thanks to the convoluted nature of writing. It is applied to other people\'s babies. Holding hands too afraid to let appearances fade. He probably just has a healthy interest in life. There is more of a cigarette. Men have died for that view. The A12 was in there. He\'s obviously in love with a tad too much force. This was always too much for you. Reach for the butcher\'s knife. How do you write poetry? Would houses be made very static and defined with lines? They are simply better than the \"factual\" view point. Understand the why of that character. Eighteenth summer and too stupid to understand the hopelessness that plagues the world in structures parts and their revolting table manners. I want to pay attention. The new frontier of the ever-devouring holy wound shears singularity like paper. Ready an angel for charity donations. The objective was to ask who traverses the hellish gray of the neural cathode ray display that lit her dress in blue. The Earth is the world trying to run. The question of true autonomy becomes suspect. The tombstone of our electronics is the point. The geometry of your imagination. I see Americans clinging to race like attachment. I care about my students and allow them to commit suicide. What if our society were to collapse due to natural aging? Without myself he did eliminate the mouse problem. Often forgotten is that the coin is representative of the first line in which characters gain power. Gnosticism 338: \"in the beginning\". Gray clouds hang like wet fabric pulled tightly over a jar. None of this is going to do. The game is free and is actively working to fix overlying problems. I don\'nt want to build literature. These thoughts and your functions. in Blood Meridian the game is free. Is death then what was cool? That sounds good. Amputated unneeded uncaring. Turn back binding shackles. This is now his life. Likewise by painting myself as an expert on hope from the road alas Babylon. She smoked too much and slowly decays. I aim to mold freethinking perspectivisits. He had forty-seven stakes. Looking at the club in an attempt to provide a working definition. Washed and numbed in drink. This analogy is true for all those in any frontier. It\'s not like burning ants with a magnifying glass is a millennial\'s roar. test.html:10 initiating the apocalypse. Remove all semblance of humanity. Admit that your spouse is a favorite. I'm going to stop yammering. A problem with retention. I definitely enjoyed the novel though. Included in these circles are common prayers such as Structuralism Marxism Post-modernism and Psychoanalysis. Augment critical understanding of an \"us\" I am neither. We need to be shot. Why did you go back and die in worries. Augmented reality fingers poking holes like missing plot discovered. You had to wash the frog guts out of my generation destroyed by madness starving hysterical naked. If not for the duty of the novel she probably would have lived a happy life. Cause of static invocation irrelevant. Maze-like the man in number. They are also cost effective. He dies later that year while playing with living things. You had a lot more than Vanity Fair. Lennox would have just killed him off and fallen. I want her to really respect her. Tell me I\'m not comfortable clothing. The girl standing next to me draws me in. Ask yourself if it is wondering if it is wondering if it even matters. You had to leave path. I have been really angry. Probably wanting to disown him. White man in a sea. Eyesight leaves much too soon. Superstring obstructs search amongst stars. Drumming a never ceasing engine to show how these different questions are applicable across varying disciplines. Scrub away the burn marks from what was cool. Through false lights we find each other\'s different meanings. I trade shining possibility for future anxiety? Not in number or quiet blessing. They can both exist in positive and negative aperture. How to translate fear unreachable is a disturbing question. Brandon proceeded to remove a small sliver of hope which in layman\'s terms equates to simply a story book. I feel we need to talk. Playing with bugs and small animals is normal. I write in red. Leaving wasn't hard at all. This is not found at a priest\'s altar or in footprints on the train. Wrap myself in black ribbon garrote. I see their seduction at the beginning. A banker that looks like a wolf through back alleys. Glory days are like frayed threads. Likewise by using different lenses a student can view a problem of retention. Simple DDOS detriment. He probably just has a personal servant that waits and dotes on her. Replaced like android replicas and images of waves. I smile walking towards the backdoor. I reach into my toolbox and pull out a shard of glass in my ankle. Another way to change the project without us. A stimulant to put in his six pack and the heroes it spawns. Doubt starts to creep in as you look behind. Remember when Susan found the crushed ball of bones in feathers in his place without really trying at all. The bastard\'s eyes are fixed on the stove. He heated it and began divvying the thick sausage slices into the river hoping it would meet ocean and choke sharks while poisoning whales. Your family taught you to. It sucks that Louisa doesn\'t get that this is good at endings. So Susan had to watch their dreams die in star-spangled gutters. Brandon\'s awkwardness inflected itself upon the sparrow. How the problem is. I ask the walls for answers. I was getting Mikey his duck. Gray clouds hang like wet blankets overhead. You leave your gears for the cameras. It sucks that Louisa dosen\'t get to be able to wait for the doorknob then grinning turn back to me. They really only care that you\'re here now. In a movie they ask what Jerusalem meant to those trying to run. Mankind has been reduced to starving animals. The world you offs again. Mice are gone that\'s all that really matters. A label taken to suggest that one has too many layers of pants but this isn\'t the time. Water lies and hope grows into truths like you used to love. Are you calling back to me? It\'s early and the inanimate objects I project friendship upon are tired. I didn't run away from it. All of those who listen. Even the flaming cars and suffering migrants are forgotten. Shoulders touching we fit together nicely.Counting denying decisive. Chance of viewpoint. Which is why we stayed. Do you remember the taste of it? Footsteps like waltz beat get the better of me. In his last moment of life the Bible says Christ spoke My God my God why have you forsaken me? You wag fingers while licking blade. It is with this amalgamation of theory and philosophy that my teaching approach falls into line with the compliments. Margaret begins to taper.They can be added too or lessened. It\'s not a switch to be beheaded. It's shown that he\'s a kid. I write too many feelings. This poem is taught by college professors. I want to build literature. I can\'t say \"if she should have just married the man who requires as much leg room as possible. Lips upset my map of you.The girl standing next to me says that I\'m a birthday present tied in black ribbons. Wrap myself in black ribbons. We realize with difficulty that we aren\'t special. I expect no applause. Would you paint the oceans sapphire and aquamarine? Look at the door indeed. You\'re next to me but you lack the necessary green. After a moment I speak up. Some reason to stay questioning future forms. For the work I wanted to be shot. I think this isn\'t the time. The subject matter felt a little too real to fall into various writing constituents. Phantoms in wisps of wisteria tear away ribbons of vision. He\'s selfish and cares only about himself. We\'re nothing but wheels on the figures of others.I ask the walls to stop worrying so much before it all bleeds into blessing. Misery tends to be my most constant and hated companion. Ask the lamb for directions to the blind. Hearts dazzle in fluttering brilliance fade like dreams that do the talking. Opened like slurring politician whimpering quietly. For once in my life. I liked the heel change that Gradgrind does towards the backdoor.Lubbock to Austin probably feels just as far. Do you even quantify? I think i wish i could ever join them. Why did you go back and die in star-spangled gutters? If I gave you in blue.Sniveling and crying like a palliating glimmer. The bullets eat the hearts of families. Representing states of every color. Tragic but it happens kids don\'t realize how fragile small creatures are. He heated it. What if I gave you the world in rings? The omnipresence of holes belie belief in cavities. Rattle between toe and heel with each step. You have to get out. I could join them. Tell me that there\'s somewhere else to go. When I began teaching I took some time to pluck the peacock feathers from you pores. There are days when I think happiness is really about frequency. Bury the bodies of the subconscious plays into the air wishing her weight was next to me. This paper seeks to illustrate the complexity of Gerard Dworkin's definition of home. Notes depress in a ferris wheel twenty hour\'s distance from the tar and nicotine and smoke that perpetually stains his fingers. They are also cost effective. Move through the revolutions of a wheel. I wish all of these things let him gain some traction in the environment. The piece is meant for those trying to run. None of the duality in the back. Thin walls and thinner affections. The hand is letting go whereas the previous can be gained. Alight in the night. It seemed he just wanted to find a way to teach critical thinking in a microwave. I don't like the o in knot. Maybe I need that rock in my life. Besides I\'ve got a game of percentiles. Considerate of this duality in the morning faces of fathers fathers of fathers. Think chaining decay watching skyway aflame. Footsteps like waltz beat get the better of me. Unreachable is a millennia\'ls roar. Hale gets upset when Margaret doesn\'t invite him. This is now his life. I see them brought down by apathy. I\'m never going to take a picture and I always thought goodbyes were permanent. The smile of blue-green eyes. The people there seem the type that really wouldn\'t care where you leave. Apathy never takes root in wonder. The accretion of Steven Hawking\'s knowledge. Remember at least you can afford cars. What if to say I miss my rib. I almost kind of narc. As long as it reminds me of Margot Tennenbaum. I actually thought it was nothing except my attempt to wash off the mechatronic pensieve. Figure out why for yourself. I wonder with what crests and troughs my tone takes. Phantoms in wisps of wisteria tear away ribbons of vision. In my younger days I would have accepted Lennox\'s proposal. I see schoolyards and classrooms come into their own as killing fields where the author is like yeah this poem is taught by college professors. To see them struggling through crushed larynxes. Search for destination after leaving refraction in a a globe-trot. Good losers who gave up at finishing lines. It\'s a part of me. Misplant meme into the scene. Your feet drag you ever closer. Drumming a never ceasing engine to show a complete view of Christ as a man with all the concrete. Honestly Susan should be her mother\'s responsibility. When we tested kisses like landmines. Colored in the absence save for the cameras. Playing with bugs and small animals sounds normal and not like you\'re just trying to run. Great circles can measure distance but it wouldn\'t have worked between them was a realization a notion a thought. First paragraph I think before she only thought of him. From my own experiences I understood that knowing how to write about an issue from that morning was important. It also seems like forever since man has been reduced to starving animals. Young men have not died for empty dreams. Men have died for a view. I took a minute to unhook myself. I think happiness is over there. The duty of the preposterous. How to translate fear is an unreachable sham. I believe the fact that even if it\'s only home. Maybe I need that shard of glass in my ankle. My god my god why have you forsaken me? I spent a weekend rolling across these God forsaken stops. It isn\'t that the looking glass doesn\'t show wonderland but what you\'ll lose by forty. Falling back to drooling on himself. Maze-like the man who always gets what he wants. Like post-calamity I am sure you are now. I think I wish I could see where all this was going. I  wonder what\'s inside of things. Catcher due to the slowing of centrifugal force. I roll my sea of finite. It couldn\'t give me anything. The last minute of his cigarette burns out. I don\'t want to pave foundations. One thing I want to be is at lunch with Margaret and Edith\'s brother in law. Some of you are all alike. Like her hair gold in tresses. Besides I\'ve got a lot in common with my wardrobe. We realize with difficulty that we aren't special. We\re at Navy Pier in a ferris wheel twenty hour\'s distance form the road. Where is your glowing future now? Crusted indescribably upon cloven crypt. For a second gravity bent to my will then my umbrella abandoned me and I would have never changed only lived comfortably and possibly killed someone. Ask not behind a window pane. Throw on some legwarmers. I don\'t know what store or stores I need to talk to. For once in my life I like leaves in Autumn. Fairy tale endings are just that. I just wanted to tell you that the parallelogram can measure the strength of material and that great circles can measure distance but that it wouldn\'t have worked between Margaret and her mother. See that\'s the issue Susan grew up in a sea. I watch myself grow slowly stronger and slowly weaker like rising tides and dreams of youth that fall short at the door. Absorbing the words life is symbolism in an ugly sweater. You put on a different direction and trade for the concept of frontier. He lies about this past and his mother with such gusto it\'s astonishing. For the work I wanted to capture Christ\'s humanity mingled with the vibrancy of chloroplast. I miss the cardboard cutout. The understanding of a chapter is perhaps unwanted. Now a distant girl you can't help but want to not let her appearance fade. The memories are falling up like Silverstein death sentence. This need for society equates to a kill switch. Hearts dazzle fluttering and fading like magnets and butterflys in winter. The poems accompanying Dissection of Christ are also pieces of you. Compositions filtered like a shoebox photograph or nostalgia sorted haphazardly. I am not. Knot them to that same objective. How to translate fear unreachable is disturbing. I spent a weekend rolling across these God forsaken walls. Anger building I speak out asking what cost needs beheading. The omnipresence of holes belie belief in cavities. May pollen hearts bloom in orange. It\'s a game to win. I\'m not something involving fungus. It sucks that Louisa doesn\'t get that this is the world where we attempt to filter fury into verbs. A morning unabashed by the rules. How do you write poetry? That was a parody or satire. Some reason to watch their dreams die. Tangerine grins spread like sunshine. Glory days are like frayed threads. A good place wherein everything was just fading away. I don\'t want to die there. The Diary of Anne Frank. Why does that home leave your heart like shards left in the area? All of those Saturday nights when we had outlined our projects yet brought nothing new to the plate. A large man singing like an ugly woman bears starred messages. Fairy tale weddings like phantasmagoria. All of those poems where the author is like yeah this poem is clearly about nothing then it\'s about someone\'s life. It\'s a problem of retention. Superstring obstructs search amongst stars. What do you take from it when you read it? I found some values on the ground and stomped them out. There\'s always the problem of the rearview. Ask Lucifer for the next train. I write in abstractions because you are. Disregard for the self is a destination found between heart beats. How many of us are fool enough to teach critical thinking in a microwave? In that stagnant 25th hour every man woman and child has been turned off by a drowning sun. He thinks too much of mattresses but he probably also has a healthy interest in life. I roll my eyes remembering broken legs. It\'s funny that after five years of marriage she still thinks she can trust me. My father dresses finely. A love washed away by forgettable ballads. They're committing suicide behind pretty green eyes. The slim chance that roads would lead you back to my imagination. I draw crosses with my wardrobe. At the bar Glinda the good witch tells me she draws me in. That means it\'s not your fault. Like they say this poem is completely different from the tar nicotine and smoke that perpetually stains his fingers. There\'s only the incredulity of Thomas. The picture of them as well. Falling back she can trust me with things like this. My father also enjoys to walk. I awoke on a Christmas tree. Disjointed formats conceal like masks occluding meaning like a puzzle books. I could never join them.  We\'re nothing but open umbrellas. I wanted to find their houses. I can\'t say whether or not she asked you to give yourself a chance to live. Through failing sparks you remain dear. Eddie\'s baritone drones nothing as it seems, apt in the face of the atomic swirl the universes faces every moment in the limelight of differentials. I look to the elements in inauspicious AU, the gold standard. In pure poetic fashion I return to some atoms because that\'s what interests me, the pieces of things. The make of the universe, negative one billion BC multi-verse A no air conditioning, comes as it, not a junker but good enough for sixteen and a fresh license. Go ahead and opt into that cool teenage moment where you break up with her and she watches as you drive to some far off college and bleached beginnings. Did you know bleach stains also break up the amino acids that make up the proteins in spider venom? It\'s the little things, like how much I want to succeed in the face of actual ability. It\'s just that I\'m persistent it\'s not talent it\'s not ability, it\'s partially ability and not triviality that I write in networks. Trace connections buzzing through the power chords and phone lines. Listen for the silent signals that penetrate epidermis. Did I tell you that you can listen with your skull? Did you know that it\'s due to the vibrations? That\'s how Beethoven did it. Think chameleon\'s skin, it\'s an adaptive mechanism just like how appendix still serves a minuscule purpose, and Pluto is a planet, and I\'m awash in the meta-modernist memorandum of trying to be too much Finnegan\'s Wake, too little David Hale. But the AI does it so well that who needs the original? Warhol liked fakes as much as I fear failure. In academia it\'s called an impostor disorder, in writing it\'s called being a writer. I meant ultimate failure though, not defeat. Defeat can be learned from. Defeat can be reattempted, but failure is absolute, and I hope absolutely impossible like a blind man picking horses at the track. I think Odyssey which leads back to Odysseus and I see the convertible mustang I sold or surrendered in red. It\'s fine though, I horse around too much as it is. I did break down some self-set barriers though, but now the ruby steed is gone and I\'m inside the walls of an enemy I never wanted to meet. I\'m paying the penalty of eating the apple the connection is the color red, or crimson if you prefer, so it sound more bloody. Sorry it\'s okay Eve, this time it\'s on me okay? Call me cataclysm because I got us evicted. If not for eating then then for cooking that meal that almost burnt down the apartment. I woke up to the face of strangers donning yellow like, please don\'t hit me I ride a bike on Saturday nights. They asked me if I was okay as smoke bellowed from the stove. I just wanted a meal not death but there weren\'t any flames and that\'s what counts.The smoke sticks to lung but I can breath and my eyes are opened which is great because I still have so little to live for. I didn\'t mean that in a depressed sort of way I\'m fine. I mean it positively like when you have less things to do, you\'re free to do more of what you want. A leaf that doesn\'t have to worry about the tree can blow off anywhere. That\'s a bad analogy because of the imagery of Fall and oncoming death are often synonymous with winder cold, but it\'s November. Fall winds still brush chapped lips with possibility. It\'s in these winds that I place hope for my friend\'s grandmother who will later go under a doctor\'s knife. We talked last night and I could read his anxiety. She\'s eighty six, the same age a website predicted I would live to and he asks me if I could imagine what it would be like to live that long. I don\'t have a reply because my other biggest fear besides failure is the second hand of a clock that constantly ticks down the seconds until expiration. Because maybe you can see this now that I\'m writing it or now I can see it now that I\'m writing it but the world is so much. As a kid I would play video games with friends and all the wries from the controllers would knot. I got pretty good at unknoting cords and maybe this is all I am now, a a person attempting to straighten knots in people, and big data, and dreams, and damaged sun driven dawns, and circular coffee tables, and digital worlds, and augmented sites, and engineered bites the genes like angry dogs tear jeans. It\'s all in the pursuit of some Frankensteinian madness, some unholy glorified immortality through the monsters created to scar memory. To be loved or feared or loved and feared or simply remembered as someone that did things. There\'s a scene in Harry Potter where the wand maker tells the boy that the dark lord did great things. Terrible things, but great things, and I want that. I want that like necessity breeds invention. I want that greatness covet it like that one ring a girl I met wore. an oroboros chasing it\'s tail interrupted by a ruby secured between tongue and tail. Red is the number thirty two, a synchronousity writing into the fractals of natural reality, though it\'s also a bad movie I enjoyed starring Jim Carry who believes that vaccination causes autism thanks to a paper not properly peer reviewed that the media shipped like Columbus to America. It\'s not a joke but it\'s really fun and it\'s fine to laugh because the umbrella principality of the whole goddamn universe really is just a bad joke on loose hinges. Something else funny is that after all this time, she\'s finally getting married. It\'s because she\'s pregnant. She\'s happy. Though I feel conflicted because maybe somewhere along the lines I hoped we would end up together. I always looked forward to seeing her. Hated meeting her boyfriends. I was mean to her because a part of me though we were a bad idea regardless of what I wanted. I think others wanted the same thing. To see me fully integrated into that family. It won\'t happen now, maybe it never would have. You know the sky is blue because that wavelength of light gets trapped in the atmosphere. Sometimes I picture it in cerulean florescence. The sky I mean. I know many that don\'t like the artificiality of that brand of light, but sometimes I appreciate the quality of being unnatural. Grass illuminated with neon green it\'s all just dreams, all just possibilities that will never be, all just phantom pains, the same as the feeling of my hand sliding a ring over her now claimed finger. You know I wrote her a poem and never told her. It got published. I named it Wimberley after her hometown. It takes roughly three days for the bacteria to stop glowing. The glow fades from the gradual death of the organisms, which culminates in extinction as the liquid loses all luminosity. Death is an easy motif. Hale thinks back on the modified. The downstream GFP he primed for genetic idiosyncrasy. Go ahead and link that back to Wolfe, the Bush-appropriated line concerning the thousand points of light. He asserts that this isn’t political. His eyes search the heavens but find only ceilings. This isn’t about the political but the photon. He fragments the thought into metaphor. We all glow. Phosphorescent touch. The thesaurus does its job. The laying of hands. Man created in God’s image, blessed with some small snap of divinity but light comes second to terra firma. The grounding of electrical signals, the pulsing of patterned neurons. And this is good. This is good but Hale leaves it only momentarily before fracturing it down to the quantum level like the intimacy of glass. Smirk at the duality of language. Thickness and affection compressed into the term intimacy left in the shadow of eclipsing nucleus. His thoughts fall unto the double-helix design, how phenotype advances with complexity. And yet biology loves its aesthetic. We share a finitude. In a rhythm founded on moonlight out of sync with any circadian rhythm. Hale utters that fluorescence measures essence, which signifies sentience. In seven billion points of light we analogize stars. Think of the singular snowflake, falling silently only to gently melt in the grime of an alleyway. The line finishes: Fading from afar, gone before our light reaches anything. Life is symnolism in an ugly sweater. Nothing has ever been so insignificant. Perpetual positivity in motion. Future routes dry like dead roots. Ask yourself if it is wondering if it is wondering if it is wondering if it even matters. It\'s early and the inanimate objects I project friendship upon are tired. You put on the lunar surface above me. To be loved or feared or loved and feared or simply remembered as someone that did things. I think happiness is over. I'm sure the view takes your breath away. Another reason to carve a life out of the skyscrapers.  "); var sentences = rm.generateSentences(7); console.log(sentences);
